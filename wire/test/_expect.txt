// ORDERED_MAP BEHAVIOR
A000 - get without put returns empty optional
		get after put returns optional containing put value
		put after put returns false
A001 - has before put returns false
		has after put returns true if key matches
		otherwise return false
A002 - replace before put returns false
		replace after put changes value
A003 - replace puts the new entry to the end of order,
		and removes the old entry

// GRAPH

// IDENTIFIER BEHAVIOR
C000 - copying identifier creates separate copies of the observed node
		uids are different between copies
		label is copied over
C001 - moving identifier moves the observed node
		uids are different between copies
		label is moved over

// CONSTANT BEHAVIOR
D000 - get constant as scalar creates constant of shape {1} and scalar provided
		get of bad type throws error
D001 - get vector constant creates constant of shape and data provided
		get of bad type throws error
D002 - derive returns 0 in constant type
		derive with respect to self throws error

// VARIABLE BEHAVIOR
E000 - sets initialization in graph and initialize with input shape
E001 - derive returns 1 in variable type if wrt is var else return 0,
		throws error if deriving uninitialized variable

// PLACEHOLDER BEHAVIOR
F000 - without providing a shape to placeholder on construction,
		assign initializes placeholder with 1-D shape of vector length
F001 - provided a partly defined shape to placeholder on construction,
		assign initializes placeholder with best fit shape of the given shape
		it guesses best fit shape for input data size,
F002 - provided a fully defined shape to placeholder on construction,
		assign initialize placeholder with defined shape.
F003 - reassign on initialized placeholder throws error if vector is larger than shape
		reassign on initialized placeholder throws error if type is different
		otherwise reassign is successful
F004 - derive returns 1 in variable type if wrt is var else return 0,
		throws error if deriving uninitialized variable

// OPERATOR BEHAVIOR
G000 - multiple operators on the same array of arguments will use the same instance
G001 - any nullptr argument returns a nullptr
G002 - any derivative with respect to itself returns 1 constant of input type

G100 - abs returns absolute of input
		derivative of immediate argument is abs(1)
G101 - neg returns negative of input
		derivative of immediate argument is neg(1)
G102 - logical_not applies not of input
		derivative of immediate argument is not(1)
G103 - sin applies std::sin function to input
		derivative of immediate argument is cos(leaf)
G104 - cos applies std::cos function to input
		derivative of immediate argument is -sin(leaf)
G105 - tan applies std::tan function to input
		derivative of immediate argument is 1/cos^2(leaf)
G106 - exp applies std::exp function to input
		derivative of immediate argument is exp(leaf) [itself]
G107 - log applies std::log function to input
		derivative of immediate argument is 1 / leaf
G108 - sqrt applies std::sqrt function to input
		derivative of immediate argument is 1 / (2 * sqrt(leaf))
G109 - round applies std::round function to input
		derivative of immediate argument is round(1)
