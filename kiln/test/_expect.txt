// ALL_INIT BEHAVIORS
A000 - set invalid type throws error regardless of construction (default, validate, string inited)
A001 - get from unset (default and Validator constructor) will return nullptr
A002 - get when set a rejected type (in Validator) will return nullptr
A003 - get when set an incompatible shape (in Validator) will return nullptr
A004 - get without shape specifier will return nullptr if allowed is not fully defined
		otherwise return Tensor of shape allowed

// SPECIAL_INIT BEHAVIORS
B000 - const_init get tensor initialized with set values repeated to fit shape
	default/string constructor with no validator or
	with validator and non-rejected type and compatible shape
B001 - unif_init get tensor initialized with uniform values between set min and max
	default/string constructor with no validator or
	with validator and non-rejected type and compatible shape
B002 - norm_init get tensor initialized with normal values at set mean and stdev
	default/string constructor with no validator or
	with validator and non-rejected type and compatible shape
