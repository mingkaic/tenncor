// TENSORSHAPE
A000 - copy and move creates/moves a data equivalent shape
A001 - as_list returns a shallow copy of the dimension values provided during construction
A002 - n_elems returns the product of all dimension value. non-fully defined shapes have n_elems of 0
		n_known obtains the product of all known dimensions
A003 - rank returns the length of the dimension vector
A004 - tensorshape is compatible if one of the shapes are undefined,
		or the tensors are of the same rank and dimension values equal for defined dimensions (> 0)
A005 - a tensorshapes is partially defined if it has a rank > 0
A006 - a tensorshapes is fully defined if it is at least partially defined
		and all its dimensional values are defined (> 0)
A007 - a tensorshape assert its rank wrt to another value or shape.
		undefined shapes can have any rank
A008 - a tensorshape can be undefined explicitly
A009 - tensorshape merge return the most defined most defined shape
		(that is dimension values > 0 are preferred)
		merging incompatible tensorshapes results in a logic error
A010 - a tensorshape can have its leading and trailing 1s removed
A011 - two tensorshapes can concatenate to form a tensorshape depending on the order of
		concatenation assuming both tensors are at least partially defined
A012 - a tensorshape's rank can be manipulated by padding with ones or clipping

A013 - converting coordinates C to sequential index I on a tensorshape S takes form:
		I = SIGMA_i=0:n(C[i]*PI_j=0:i-1(S[i])) where n is rank of S, and S[-1] is 1
A014 - index from coordinate C on a tensorshape equals the initial index converted to C (reverse of A013)
A015 - n_elems and n_known account for shapes with groupings
A016 - groupings on unknown dimensions (ones with value of 0) do not set grouping (is_grouped returns false)
A017 - memory_indices maps shape index obtained from sequential index to every element along grouped dimension
A018 - shapes are padded with ones may match shapes with shapes of similar non-padded values and vice versa
		zero paddings may substitute ones (for example: <0, 1, 5, 6> matches <1, 5, 6> or <5, 6> or <0, 0, 5, 6>)
		todo: THIS IS DEFINITELY BROKEN, <0, 1, 5, 6> will not match <1, 5, 6> because leading 1's are culled before 0s

// TENSOR
B000 - scalar tensor constructrion creates allocates a tensor of rank 1, nelems = 1
		scalar tensor's raw data is initialized as the scalar
B001 - default tensor construction creates an undefined tensor
		constructing with a fully_defined_shape is allocated on construction
		otherwise tensor is not allocated
		unallocated tensors have 0 bytes, allocated tensors have bytes of n_elems * sizeof(type)
B002 - copy and move creates/moves a tensor of equivalent shape and raw data
B003 - tensor can access shape information through get_shape and n_elems
B004 - tensors coordinates <c0, c1, ..., cn> are mapped to
		output tensor vector with shape <d0, d1, ..., dn> by sum_i=0:n(product_j=0:i(dj) * ci)
(UNTESTED) B005 - set allocator will throw runtime_error if alloc_id is invalid, 
		otherwise it will use the corresponding allocator
B006 - reshape changes clips or pads raw data with zeros if the tensor is allocated
		if this is nonfully defined, it will not be allocated
		additionally allowed shape is undated to be more defined
B007 - default allocate (no provided shape) returns false if allowed shape is not fully defined.
		otherwise it is allocated. will not reallocate if already allocated
B008 - deallocation fails if tensor is not allocated,
		otherwise alloc_shape must be undefined and raw_data is nullptr
B009 - allocate will fail if provided shape is not compatible with allowed shape
		allocate will not reallocate if this is allocated and shape is identical to current allocated shape
		otherwise allocate may reallocate
B010 - copy_from another tensor will return true if other tensor is allocated
		and shape is fully defined. resulting tensor will have the same value as
		other within specified shape dimensions, data not specified by other is 0

// ITENSOR
C000 - scalar itensor constructrion creates allocates a tensor of rank 1, nelems = 1
		scalar itensor's raw data is initialized as the scalar
C001 - default itensor construction creates an undefined itensor
		constructing with a fully_defined_shape is allocated on construction
		otherwise itensor is not allocated
		unallocated tensors have 0 bytes, allocated tensors have bytes of n_elems * sizeof(type)
C002 - copy and move creates/moves a tensor of equivalent shape and raw data
C003 - itensor can provides utility access to content tensor shapes in the form of rank, and dims
C004 - two tensors are the same size if their allowed shapes are compatible or
		they are both allocated and their trimmed shapes are compatible
C005 - two tensors are compatible if their alloc_shape if allocated (or allowed_shape) are compatible
C006 - a tensor is compatible with a data vector if data is compatible
		if data.size() == alloc_shape if allocated (or allowed_shape) size
		loosely compatible if data.size() < alloc_shape if allocated (or allowed_shape) size
		unmet condition returns undefined optional
C007 - guess shape return a shape if the shape has n_elems == data.size() and is compatible
		with allowed_shape otherwise return undefined optional
		loosely guess return a shape if n_elems < data.size() and is compatible
		with allowed_shape shape otherwise return undefined optional
(UNTESTED) C008 - serialize to valid tensor_proto should stores data, type, and shape 
		(allowed and allocated) to a file that is readable via from_proto

// TENSOR_HANDLER
D000 - transfer function takes output tensor and some argument tensors
		transfer performs operation on arguments and apply to output
D001 - constant initializer fills a tensor with a
		particular scalar defined at the construction of initializer
D002 - random uniform initializer fills a tensor with values
		between low and high bounds specified at initializer construction
		random normal initializes values with mean close to the specified mean
D003 - copying and moving transfer, const_init, rand_uniform, rand_normal
		creates/moves the shaper and forward functions
		cloning from itensor_handler on any of the handlers instances
		will return their respective instances
