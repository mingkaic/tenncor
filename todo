=== feature ===
P2 - workout convolution grad in ead
P3 - implement subgraph stand-in for rocnnet layers
P4 - implement reduce_prod gradient using Eigen cumprod

=== structure ===
P2 - generalize grader and move to ade (otherwise ade does not fulfil its main purpose)
P3 - generalize rule conversion feature for all implementations of ade nodes

=== correction ===
P3 - reorient tests so that tests cover its own immediate module
P3 - maximize coverage
P3 - test rule conversion
P4 - test complicate equations (generate random valid equations)

=== transparency ===
P4 - add even more debugging tools
P4 - formalize codestyle
P4 - refactor, and rename variables to improve readability
P4 - conform to some bazel style/convention (or change to another build tool)

=== update ===
P2 - update all fmts usages
P3 - address warnings

=== performance ===
general performance:
P4 - remove unordered_map/unordered_set if we're not using them properly
P4 - define optimization conversion rules to increase data accuracy
P4 - more performance test

run-time performance:
P2 - define session interface then improve session implementation
P3 - define dataflow to take advantage of parallel processing at node-level
P4 - investigate remote sessions for distributed processing

graph-setup performance:
P3 - improve optimization rule matching
