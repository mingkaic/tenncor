>>>>>>> inprogress >>>>>>>
   - enhance opt to accept and use multi-typed attributes,
      and eteq extension to change shape according to optimized attributes
   - renable test for duplicate removal optimization filter
P2 - upgrade layr to allow restructuring recurrent structure sequence length
   - fix group sum (see derivative issue)
   - fix gru demo to run optimally

>>> c++20 upgrades >>>
   - replace ManagedJob and Sequence with std::interrupt_token and std::jthread
   - replace fmts with std::format/format_to
   - use constant PI / square 2 etc.
   - upgrade log with source location
   - add discard reasons for unshared_ptr tensor makes

=== transparency/code readability ===
P2 - generate value-range graph to detect erroneous operators
      - for each node, generate "range" tensor (min, max) that identifies the expected min-max value of that node
      - this graph can help developers quickly identifies unstable nodes
P2 - centralize global context structures
P2 - create global context for setting local logger
P2 - provide graph-setup time summary when failing to match shapes (re-use experimental/locator)
P2 - implement debug option that locates nodes by some attr/parent-child relationship/etc.
P3 - implement custom logger that displays location of nearest node on fatal errors
P2 - layr get_contents needs to return context for output tensors
   - upgrade pygen to support multiline comments in API
   - fix variable assignment in pybind11 code sections to error if py::array is not numpy
   - use https://github.com/pybind/pybind11_bazel
P4 - add even more debugging tools
P4 - conform to some bazel style/convention (or change to another build tool)
P4 - investigate adopting more of boost in place of cppkg
P5 - refactor, and rename variables to improve readability
P5 - formalize codestyle

=== usage ===
P2 - demo A3C
   - implement models concerning visual and audio processing, and semantic data processing
   - separate supervised and unsupervised trainers (since they have different statefulness)

=== demos ===
P2 - fix convolutional nn demo
   - switch rbm and dbn demos to use tensorflow datasets
   - improve rnn demo to use more stable weights

=== feature ===
P2 - make shape dimension size configurable (instead of fixed rank_cap)
P3 - function with multiple typed inputs (e.g.: if_then_else)
P4 - implement reduce_prod gradient using Eigen cumprod
   - implement control edges to replace tensor and layer attributes OR
      generalize tensor attribute to include control information

=== correction ===
P2 - full test coverage for tenncor::layer and tenncor::nn namespaces
P2 - fully test onnx and standard compatibility
P2 - test opt module against varying graphs
P2 - reorient tests so that tests cover its own immediate module
P2 - fix rbm demo converging to infinity problem
P2 - test dbg module
P3 - test complicate equations (generate random valid equations)
P3 - maximize coverage
P3 - test rocnnet, and trainer (or subgraph equivalent)

=== performance ===

run-time performance:
   - improve grader/optimization rule according to rnn, lstm, gru
P3 - improve ccur module
P2 - make eigen device configurable
P4 - implement GPU settings
P4 - improve session implementation
P4 - investigate remote sessions for distributed processing

stability:
P3 - define optimization conversion rules to increase data stability

compile-time performance:
P3 - convert as many shared_ptr to unique_ptr
P4 - remove unordered_map/unordered_set if we're not using them properly

performance verification:
P3 - benchmark test rocnnet against various other frameworks (CPU only)
P4 - more performance test

=== update ===
P5 - update all fmts usages
P5 - address warnings
