correction:
P3 - reorient tests so that tests cover its own immediate module
P3 - maximize coverage
P4 - test complicate equations (generate random valid equations)

transparency:
P4 - add more debugging tools
P4 - formalize codestyle
P4 - refactor, and rename variables to improve readability
P4 - conform to some bazel style/convention (or change to another build tool)

performance:
P2 - implement reduction using Eigen
P3 - use Eigen::Matrix whenever possible
P3 - use scalars whenever possible
P4 - investigate operation shortcut detection
P4 - implement convolution using Eigen
P4 - implement optimization options to increase data accuracy
P4 - performance test
