correction:
P3 - reorient tests so that tests cover its own immediate module
P3 - maximize coverage
P4 - test complicate equations (generate random valid equations)

structure:
P3 - generalize grader and move to ade (otherwise ade does not fulfil its main purpose)
    - alternatively, scrap ade (generality) and aim to maximize performance (restructure llo+ade as compile-based AD-engine)

transparency:
P4 - add more debugging tools
P4 - formalize codestyle
P4 - refactor, and rename variables to improve readability
P4 - conform to some bazel style/convention (or change to another build tool)

performance:
P2 - implement convolution using Eigen
P3 - implement sub-graph recognition optimizations (recognize patterns such as X * Y * Z / Y = X * Z or 1 / (1 + - exp (X)) = sigmoid(X))
P3 - use scalars whenever possible
P4 - investigate operation shortcut detection
P4 - implement optimization options to increase data accuracy
P4 - more performance test

nitpicks:
- remove unordered_map/unordered_set if we're not using them properly

update:
- update all fmts usages
