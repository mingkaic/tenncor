P3 = "want to have"
P4 = "nice to have/need investigating"
P5 = "get to it eventually"

=== feature ===
P1 - make shape dimension size configurable
P2 - make constant pre-calculation configurable in opt module
P2 - reimplement conv nn layer + dbn
    P3 - force dbn to conform to established trainer pattern (if no subgraph yet)
P3 - implement control nodes/edges for assignments
P4 - implement reduce_prod gradient using Eigen cumprod

=== transparency ===
P2 - provide graph-setup time summary when failing to match shapes
P4 - add even more debugging tools
P4 - formalize codestyle
P4 - refactor, and rename variables to improve readability
P4 - conform to some bazel style/convention (or change to another build tool)
P4 - investigate adopting more of boost in place of cppkg

=== structure ===
P2 - create global context for all ade/ead/tag singletons, then make context configurable
P4 - remove ead helper functions

=== correction ===
P2 - fix rbm demo converging to infinity problem
P2 - test tag module
P2 - test dbg module
P2 - test opt module more
P3 - test complicate equations (generate random valid equations)
P3 - reorient tests so that tests cover its own immediate module
P3 - maximize coverage
P3 - test rocnnet + eqns, modl, and trainer (or subgraph equivalent)

=== update ===
P2 - update all fmts usages
P3 - address warnings

=== performance ===
general performance:
P3 - benchmark test rocnnet against various other frameworks (CPU only)
P3 - convert as many shared_ptr to unique_ptr
P4 - remove unordered_map/unordered_set if we're not using them properly
P4 - define optimization conversion rules to increase data accuracy
P4 - more performance test

run-time performance:
P3 - define dataflow to take advantage of parallel processing at node-level
P4 - implement GPU settings
P4 - improve session implementation
P4 - investigate remote sessions for distributed processing
