correctness:
- use testify for regression test
- implement better fallback strategy when test server is unavailable
- thoroughly test cli
- update graphmgr and test complicate equations

transparency:
- combine ade and llo cli into one powerful interactive cli
- add mechanism to map opname to opcode, so cli can avoid FUNCODE enum
- add more debugging tools
- investigate llo api: experiment with top-level code
- formalize codestyle
- refactor, and rename variables to improve readability

performance:
- reduce shared_ptr overhead
- implement optimization options to decrease equation graph size
- implement optimization options to increase data accuracy

features:
- implement group
- implement deep copy utility
- investigate better error handling strategy (perhaps allow error log plugin)
- implement convolution
