tests:
- use testify for regression test
- implement better fallback strategy when test server is unavailable
- move test generation out of this repo

move out:
- update graphmgr

readability:
- improve comments according to some styleguide
- make comment styles consistent (proably // instead of /* */ )
- refactor, and rename variables to improve readability
- add more debugging tools
- investigate llo api: experiment with top-level code

performance:
- reduce shared_ptr overhead
- implement optimization options to decrease equation graph size
- implement optimization options to increase data accuracy

features:
- implement group
- implement deep copy utility
- implement clip
- reuse cli/util/ascii_* for debug tools, and simplify traversal strategy
- investigate better error handling strategy (perhaps allow error log plugin)
