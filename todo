P2 = "todo"
P3 = "want to have"
P4 = "nice to have/need investigating"
P5 = "get to it eventually"

=== usage ===
   - implement fully recurrent
P2 - implement GRU
P2 - implement LSTM
P2 - implement attention transformer
   - demo A3C, attention encoder+decoder
   - implement models concerning visual and audio processing, and semantic data processing
   - separate supervised and unsupervised trainers (since they have different statefulness)

=== demos ===
P2 - improve convolutional nn demo
   - switch rbm and dbn demos to use tensorflow datasets

=== feature ===
P1 - improve layr parameter serialization
   - make dense contract dimensions configurable
P2 - allow users to create ambiguous nodes holding shapes with ambiguous dimensions (
    shape values denoted in python by None)
P2 - make shape dimension size configurable (instead of fixed rank_cap)
P2 - make constant pre-calculation configurable in opt module
P3 - implement control nodes/edges for assignments
P4 - implement reduce_prod gradient using Eigen cumprod
P5 - implement onnx support (https://github.com/onnx/onnx)

=== transparency/code readability ===
   - layr get_contents needs to return context for output tensors
   - generate value-range graph to automatically detect erroneous operators
      - for each node, generate "range" tensor (min, max) that identifies the expected min-max value of that node
      - this graph can help developers quickly identifies unstable nodes
   - upgrade pygen to support multiline comments in API
   - create global context for setting local logger
   - fix variable assignment in pybind11 code sections to error if py::array is not numpy
   - use https://github.com/pybind/pybind11_bazel
P2 - unify pybind11 utility functions
P2 - provide graph-setup time summary when failing to match shapes
P4 - add even more debugging tools
P4 - conform to some bazel style/convention (or change to another build tool)
P4 - investigate adopting more of boost in place of cppkg
P5 - refactor, and rename variables to improve readability
P5 - formalize codestyle

=== performance ===
P3 - improve ccur module

run-time performance:
   - implement group sum and group prod using EigenAssignTens
   - make eigen device configurable
P3 - define dataflow to take advantage of parallel processing at node-level
P4 - implement GPU settings
P4 - improve session implementation
P4 - investigate remote sessions for distributed processing

stability:
P3 - define optimization conversion rules to increase data stability

compile-time performance:
P3 - convert as many shared_ptr to unique_ptr
P4 - remove unordered_map/unordered_set if we're not using them properly

performance verification:
P3 - benchmark test rocnnet against various other frameworks (CPU only)
P4 - more performance test

=== correction ===
   - optimization fails when functor is initialized on construction
P2 - test eteq funcarg
P2 - test dropout layer
P2 - centralize global context structures
P2 - reorient tests so that tests cover its own immediate module
P2 - fix rbm demo converging to infinity problem
P2 - test dbg module
P2 - test opt module more
P3 - test complicate equations (generate random valid equations)
P3 - maximize coverage
P3 - test rocnnet, and trainer (or subgraph equivalent)

=== update ===
P5 - update all fmts usages
P5 - address warnings
