correction:
P3 - reorient tests so that tests cover its own immediate module
P3 - maximize coverage
P4 - test complicate equations (generate random valid equations)

structure:
P3 - generalize grader and move to ade (otherwise ade does not fulfil its main purpose)

transparency:
P4 - add more debugging tools
P4 - formalize codestyle
P4 - refactor, and rename variables to improve readability
P4 - conform to some bazel style/convention (or change to another build tool)

--- performance:
general perforamnce:
- remove unordered_map/unordered_set if we're not using them properly
P4 - implement optimization options to increase data accuracy
P4 - more performance test

run-time performance:
P2 - define session interface then improve session implementation

graph-setup performance:
- improve optimization rule matching

feature:
P2 - implement convolution using Eigen for ead and llo

update:
- update all fmts usages
- address warnings
